## Brad's Bookstore

Created a little demo application called <em>Brad's Books</em> to learn Laravel a php MVC framework, which I must admit, is pretty darn awesome.

You can see a running demo of it online at [laravelbooks.limecat.ninja](https://laravelbooks.limecat.ninja).

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
